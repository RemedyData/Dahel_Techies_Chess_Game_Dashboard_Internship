***Disclaimer:*** This is not a real company as we know this is a dataset compiled by Dahel Consultant Techies for Internship purposes. 


## Introduction

This is chess game performance analysis. It is done by analyzing data from  the chess game table which comprises of ranking_date column, rank	column, name column, title column, country column, rating column, games column, and birth_year column. I used Excel to get an overview of the dataset before importing it into Power BI where the actual analysis was carried out. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to know:

- How many games were played?
- How many players played?
- How many countries participated in the game?
- What is the average age of the players?
- Top 5 highest ranking players?
- Countries with the most players?
- Player that played the most game.
- What is the correlation between players age and their rating?

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- Power BI concepts like:
   - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations
   - Developing general DAX calculations that deal with text and numbers,
   - Performed advanced DAX calculations for solving statistical measures and other mathematical formulas,
   - Data Modelling,
   - Measures,
   - Filters,
   - Tooltips,
   - Page buttons,
   - Data visualization

## Data Transformation:

**Step 1:**
- After downloading the dataset, I imported it POWERBI.

**Step 2:**
- It loaded the dataset authomatically in Power Query Editor but there was no cleaning needed because it was already a cleaned data.

**Step 3:**
- The data type year was changed to whole number

**Step 4:**
- A new column was created for Age of the player as at 2024

**Step 5:**
- After checking the columns, it was loaded into POWERBI for visualization

## Data Analysis and Visualization:

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.
I arrived at a report with a single dashboard consisting of different visuals such as bar chart, doughnut chart, line chart, slicer, and KPIs, giving the summary of the insights gained into the company's performance.

## Features of the Report:
The dashboard conveys information about the following key areas:
- Number of games played
- Number of players played
- Number of countries participated in the game
- The average age of the players
- Top 5 highest ranking players
- Countries with the most players
- Player that played the most game
- The correlation between players age and their rating

## Analysis

Summary of the insights gained into the chess Game performance: 

- The total games played was 121,868 and 346 players from 64 countries participated in the game.
- There is no correlation between player’s age and their rating
- There was four different titles (f, m, g and wg)
- The average age of the player as of 2024 is 44 years old. 
- Russia had the highest number of players in the game followed by Ukraine and then China.
- Tiviakov Sergei from Netherland played the most gamed followed Van Wely Loek also from Netherland.
- Russian played the most game followed by Ukraine. 
- Top ranked players are Anand Viswanathan, Carlsen Magnus, Kasparov Garry, Kramnik Vladimir, Topalov Veselin.

## Recommendation

- Choosing Anand Viswanathan, Carlsen Magnus, Kasparov Garry, Kramnik Vladimir, Topalov Veselin, as they are the top ranked players, will yield more wins.


- Tiviakov Sergei from Netherland who played the most gamed followed Van Wely Loek also from Netherland should be given more preference by the chess selecting teams inorder to triumph more.
  
- As for there is no correlation between player’s age and their rating from the analysis above, player's age should not be a limiting factor to express their dexterity.
